# TelemetryReport Data Structure

The TelemetryReport data structure consists of the following sections:

* header - contains metadata about the telemetry report
  * reportId - a UUID that differentiates this report from other reports
    generated by the same client
  * reportTimeStamp - the UTC timestamp for when the bundle was generated,
    formatted in [RFC3339nano](../../telemetrytimestamp.md) format
  * reportClientId - the clientId of the telemetry client generating this
    report, as specified in the registraion used to successfully register
    the client with the upstream telemetry server.
  * reportAnnotations - a possibly empty list of
    [telemetry annotation tags](../../telemetrytag.md)
* payload - a list of one or more [TelemetryBundle](telemetrybundle.md) objects
* footer - contains a checksum of the payload section

***NOTE***: The [telemetry bundles](telemetrybundle.md) in a report payload
may not all originate from the same telemetry client, e.g. they may have been
relayed through one or more telemetry relays.
